# Tic-Tac-Toe-game
# The game starts by initializing an empty board represented by a list of 9 spaces. The "print_board" function is used to display the current state of the board. The "player_move" function allows players to make a move by entering a number between 1 and 9, corresponding to the spaces on the board. The "is_victory" function checks to see if a player has won by checking for a winning combination of spaces on the board. The "is_draw" function checks to see if the game has ended in a draw by checking if there are any empty spaces on the board. The game continues in a loop until a player wins or the game ends in a draw.
